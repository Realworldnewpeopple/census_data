# census_data_model using machinelearning algorithm as well as deep learning algorithm

Its a dynamic program where you can choose the model u want to run and execute the accuracy rate as well as graph for validation vs testing data set is automatically created and saved.

There are more codes to develop into better output dynamically where you just have place any data set choose the model and get your requierd output.

Accordingly you can use your deeplearning model  which will be automatically saved.
